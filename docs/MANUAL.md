# User Manual

Welcome to the interactive solar system user manual. This is an online application of an interactive solar system where users can explore and learn more about the solar system. Our targeted users for this product are students, teachers, or anyone who are looking to learn more and interested in exploring the solar system. We believe that through this interactive experience, users will have a more complete understanding on how the solar system works.

### User Demographic:
The main intended user for our app is a student who is interested in learning more about the physics of our universe and solar system.

### Getting Started:
To use the interactive solar system, you will need to have a web browser installed on your computer. The product is accessible through itch.io, and you can access it by following the link provided in the README.md.

### Main Menu:
When entering the app, the user is first greeted with a main menu. There are two buttons on the page, and about button and a start button. The about button will bring you to the about page where it displays the controls of the game. The start button will bring you to a settings page where you can change the settings of the solar system before entering. From there you can start the simulation.

### Solar System Settings:
The solar system settings page allows a user to edit the planets to be different masses. The default checkboxes will keep the planet at its default mass unless unchecked. When the box is unchecked, it allows a user to change the mass of the planet to their liking. If the box is re-checked, the mass will go back to the default. To add planets, users can click on the "Add Planet!" button which will allow them to add up to 5 planets. The user can choose generally how far the new planet will start from the sun in terms of the other planets around in a dropdown menu. They can also change the mass of these added planets as well. There is also an option to delete added planets in this page. 

### Navigation:
The interactive solar system allows you to navigate the solar system by pressing 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' on keyboard.'z' is to move down and 'space' is to move up, and 'shift' will speed up movement. You can use your mouse to rotate and pan the view. When you are in the solar system, when you click on the scene your mouse icon disappears and you can click on the planets in the solar system using the crosshair in the middle. Pressing 'e' disconnects the controls of the user and makes the mouse reappear and allows a user to click on one of the buttons on the screen of the solar system, pressing 'e' again will reconnect the controls. 'Tab' is a hotkey for pause/resume the simulation. 'q' brings up a window that allows the user to either return to the main menu or back into the game.

### Pausing
There is a pause button in the main simuation that will stop the movement of the planets (TAB as the hotkey). In this state, the user can move around and observe the positioning of the planets.

### Planetary Information:
To access information about a planet, click when the crosshair in the center of the view is on the planet, and a brief panel with information about that planet will appear. These information will include details about the planet's name, history, size, normal mass, and distance from the sun.

### Adding Planets:
In addition to adding planets in the setttings page, the user can add planets using the "add a planet" button within the simulation. The user can see how a randomly added planet may change the path of other planets around with this feature.
