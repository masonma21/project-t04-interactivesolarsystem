# User Manual

Welcome to the interactive solar system user manual. This is an online application of a interactive solar system where users can explore and learn more about the solar system. Our targeted users for this product are students, teachers, or anyone who are looking to learn more and interested in exploring the solar system. We believe that through this interactive experience, users will have a more complete understanding on how the solar system works.

### User Demographic:
The main intended user for our app is a student who is interested in learning more about the physics of our universe and solar system.

### Getting Started:
To use the interactive solar system, you will need to have a web browser installed on your computer. The product is accessible through itch.io, and you can access it by following the link provided.

### Navigation:
The interactive solar system allows you to navigate the solar system by pressing 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' on keyboard. You can use your mouse rotate and pan the view. 'z' is to move down and 'space' is to move up, and 'shift' will speed up movement. 'e' disconnects the controls of the user if they want to click on one of the buttons without changing their view, pressing 'e' again will reconnect the controls. 'Tab' is a hotkey for pause/resume the simulation.

### Pausing
There is a pause button in the main simuation that will stop the movement of the planets (TAB as the hotkey). In this state, the user can movea around and observe the positioning of the planets.

### Planetary Information:
To access information about a planet, click your mouse on a planet, and a brief panel with information about that planet will appear. These information will include details about the planet's name, history, size, and distance from the sun.

### Editing Planets:
The user is able to edit planet masses after clicking the start page and choose to add more random planets as well. The user can choose the position and set different masses for planets. In the simulation, the user can press 'e' to call the cursor and get back to intermediary page to edit or add planets.
