# Ethan's Contributions

I made a few contributions, although for some reason (probably Unity) most of them don't show up
under the 'contributions' graph for github.

I found the models to use for the planets in the project, and instantiated the four terrestrial (inner) planets. After
that, I changed the scene name for the solar system to something more appropriate (previously it was something generic like 'MainScene').
I added the rest of the planets to the simulation (fixing an issue that caused the first four to go missing in the process) and modified
the GUI so it could cope with different screen resolutions (to a limited extent).

I was responsible for implementing the Unit and Integration Tests for our project. I changed some values to
make the planet's rotation on their axis proportional to reality, and adjusted the planet's starting positions to allow for accurate 3D
orbits (thus making the simulation more realistic).

Finally, I disabled the collision between users and the planets in the simulation (so the user doesn't accidentally knock them off course)
and made a few final adjustments to the GUI and the planet's rotation about their axis. 

(I also helped my teammates a few times, like assisting Richard in getting the gravity working for new planets in his "Add Random Planets" feature.)
