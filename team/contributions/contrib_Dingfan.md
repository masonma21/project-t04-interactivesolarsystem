Initially, I started the project by setting up Unity graphics and see how well it would work with our project. Then, I implemented the self rotation of all planets. I made the sun the only light source in the universe so all shadows are casted correctly upon each planet. I implemented the 'escape' key to pause the movements of the entire simulation including the planets and the camera. I also implemented 'shift' key which speeds up the main camera. I led retro 2 which was a major milestone towards the MVP1.
