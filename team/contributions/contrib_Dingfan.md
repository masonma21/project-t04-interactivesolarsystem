My contribution towards the project has been the following:
1. Initially, I started the project by setting up Unity graphics and see how well it would work with our project. 
2. I implemented the self rotation of all planets. 
3. I made the sun the only light source in the universe so all shadows are casted correctly upon each planet. 
4. I implemented the 'escape' key to pause the movements of the entire simulation including the planets and the camera. 
5. I implemented 'shift' key which speeds up the main camera. 
6. I updated the details in the about page so all UI controls are accurate.
7. I led retro 2 which was a major milestone towards the MVP1.

In general, I believe that my input demonstrates competence in managing different technical aspects of the project, as well as assuming leadership responsibilities to steer our team towards achieving our goals.
