# Elizabeth's Contributions

Working on this project, I have contributed by working on adding in a background to the solar system and creating the intermediary page between the main 
menu and the solar system simulation where users can change the masses of planets and create new planets. I also added a new scene to hold the information
for the current masses of the planets that can then pass that information through all the scenes and not get destroyed or duplicated through switching scenes.

I also implemented the initial functionality 'e' key to disconnect the controls from the scene for the user to click on other buttons without moving their view.
