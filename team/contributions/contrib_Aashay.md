My contributions to this project were the follwing: 

1. First did some research on Unity and tried to gain a general understanding of the technology. 
2. I set up the Itch.io deployment platform by setting up the account, username and password. 
3. I worked on the start and about pages and their respective buttons. I set up the transitions between them and updated the about page with the key controls for the game. 
4. After receiving MVP feedback, I worked on changing the sensitivity of the mouse and the camera movements. I changed the code to make the user experience smoother and slowed down the camera movement a little bit as well. 
5. I added the cross hair in the center of the screen which can be used to click on planets to see their information. The mouse stays locked at the center of the screen while the user is moving around and comes back when the game is paused. 
6. Made some minor UI tweaks before the final release for better user experience 
7. In addition to that, I led some of the sprint planning meetings and led Retro 3 which helped our team to flesh out some of the high priority features and find out ways to adapt our workflow. 
8. I also worked on the Design Document that goes out details of our design process, user experience, and system architecture.
