## Mason's Contributions
During my involvement in this project, I contributed in several ways:
1. Imported all the necessary scripts and information for all the planets.
2. Modified the visual background of the solar system to a galaxy.
3. Added revolution, self-rotation, and orbits for all the planets.
4. Implemented a function where users can view detailed information about a planet by clicking on it.
5. Added functionality for users to move in space using the keys 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'z', and spacebar.
6. Changed the shader of the Sun to enhance its appearance.
7. Added a back button on the upper right corner of the simulation to allow users to return to the start page.
8. Created a pop-up menu with 'q' key, showing two buttons: back and quit.
9. Led the first retro meeting and several sprint planning meetings to ensure that we had a clear vision for the project and specific steps to achieve our goals.

Overall, I think my contributions show the ability to handle various technical aspects of the project while also taking on leadership responsibilities to help guide our team towards success.
