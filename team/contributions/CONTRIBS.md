# Team Contributions

**** Note on the contributions graph: Unity changes a lot of lines when we change things with the scenes, so the lines/files changed aren't indicative of 
the amount of work done.

## Aashay's Contributions

My contributions to this project were the follwing: 

1. First did some research on Unity and tried to gain a general understanding of the technology. 
2. I set up the Itch.io deployment platform by setting up the account, username and password. 
3. I worked on the start and about pages and their respective buttons. I set up the transitions between them and updated the about page with the key controls for the game. 
4. After receiving MVP feedback, I worked on changing the sensitivity of the mouse and the camera movements. I changed the code to make the user experience smoother and slowed down the camera movement a little bit as well. 
5. I added the cross hair in the center of the screen which can be used to click on planets to see their information. The mouse stays locked at the center of the screen while the user is moving around and comes back when the game is paused. 
6. Made some minor UI tweaks before the final release for better user experience 
7. In addition to that, I led some of the sprint planning meetings and led Retro 3 which helped our team to flesh out some of the high priority features and find out ways to adapt our workflow. 
8. I also worked on the Design Document that goes out details of our design process, user experience, and system architecture. 

## Dingfan's Contributions

My contribution towards the project has been the following:
1. Initially, I started the project by setting up Unity graphics and see how well it would work with our project. 
2. I implemented the self rotation of all planets. 
3. I made the sun the only light source in the universe so all shadows are casted correctly upon each planet. 
4. I implemented the 'escape' key to pause the movements of the entire simulation including the planets and the camera. 
5. I implemented 'shift' key which speeds up the main camera. 
6. I updated the details in the about page so all UI controls are accurate.
7. I led retro 2 which was a major milestone towards the MVP1.

In general, I believe that my input demonstrates competence in managing different technical aspects of the project, as well as assuming leadership responsibilities to steer our team towards achieving our goals.

## Elizabeth's Contributions

Working on this project, I have contributed by working on adding in a background to the solar system and creating the intermediary page between the main 
menu and the solar system simulation where users can change the masses of planets and create new planets. I also added a new scene to hold the information
for the current masses of the planets that can then pass that information through all the scenes and not get destroyed or duplicated through switching scenes.

I implemented the initial functionality 'e' key to disconnect the controls from the scene for the user to click on other buttons without moving their view.

I led some sprint planning meetings so that we could have a clear view of what we wanted the product to be and what specific steps we needed to realize what we wanted to in that sprint.

I figured out how to deploy our app on itch.io and have been keeping it updated as necessary.

## Ethan's Contributions

I made a few contributions, although for some reason (probably Unity) most of them don't show up
under the 'contributions' graph for github.

I found the models to use for the planets in the project, and instantiated the four terrestrial (inner) planets. After
that, I changed the scene name for the solar system to something more appropriate (previously it was something generic like 'MainScene').
I added the rest of the planets to the simulation (fixing an issue that caused the first four to go missing in the process) and modified
the GUI so it could cope with different screen resolutions (to a limited extent).

I was responsible for implementing the Unit and Integration Tests for our project. I changed some values to
make the planet's rotation on their axis proportional to reality, and adjusted the planet's starting positions to allow for accurate 3D
orbits (thus making the simulation more realistic).

Finally, I disabled the collision between users and the planets in the simulation (so the user doesn't accidentally knock them off course)
and made a few final adjustments to the GUI and the planet's rotation about their axis. 

(I also helped my teammates a few times, like assisting Richard in getting the gravity working for new planets in his "Add Random Planets" feature.)



## Mason's Contributions
During my involvement in this project, I contributed in several ways:
1. Imported all the necessary scripts and information for all the planets.
2. Modified the visual background of the solar system to a galaxy.
3. Added revolution, self-rotation, and orbits for all the planets.
4. Implemented a function where users can view detailed information about a planet by clicking on it.
5. Added functionality for users to move in space using the keys 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'z', and spacebar.
6. Changed the shader of the Sun to enhance its appearance.
7. Added a back button on the upper right corner of the simulation to allow users to return to the start page.
8. Created a pop-up menu with 'q' key, showing two buttons: back and quit.
9. Led the first retro meeting and several sprint planning meetings to ensure that we had a clear vision for the project and specific steps to achieve our goals.

Overall, I think my contributions show the ability to handle various technical aspects of the project while also taking on leadership responsibilities to help guide our team towards success.
