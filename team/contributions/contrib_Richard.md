My contributions to this project were the following: 

1. At the very start, I did research on the technologies that we might use to build and host the project, including Heroku, React and Unity. Finally, through a YouTube video on deploying WebGL apps, I got to know itch.io which is a free platform that hosts Unity games. I shared it to the team and we thought it was a perfect solution of deployment because we don't have to care about building our own websites.

2. During first iteration of our development, I explored basics of Unity and watched a few videos to learn how to build a world in Unity. After that, I began to implement all the fundamental codes that control the behavior and physics of our simulated solar system. These functions realized orbiting of the celestials and defined the basic rules of planetary interactions.

3. After MVP, I started working on the new features that deal with the feedback from MVP review. First is the pause/resume button that freezes the solar system. I added the button at the upper right corner of the UI. It enables the user to pause the scene and get a static view of the solar system.

4. Another post-MVP feature I implemented was adding random planets. It is a button under the pause/resume which allows users to add a random template planet in the solar system, and the system will make realtime changes on every existing planet's behavior according to the newly added planet's parameters. This feature serves our user story that the student wants to see how the simulation would be changed with some modifications.

5. I also helped Elizabeth with her development of intermediary page where user can add customized planets before entering the simulation. Basically, I wrote a function that connects the data input on intermediary page to the main scene so that the customized planets can be correctly shown in the solar system.

6. Besides technical stuff, I also contributed to two team presentations this quarter by offering ideas and narrating.
