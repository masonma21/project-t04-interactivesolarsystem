# User Feedback Needs

## Possible Ideas
* It would be nice to have user feedback on how intuitive the controls and features are. We are all very well versed in the controls by now but we would want to see how we a user could navigate the app without any instructions from us on how to use it. We could measure how many features each user accessed or how long it takes them to figure out how to use the app.
* Another thing we want user feedback on is their thoughts on the UI design. Coming from a technical standpoint, we can't always tell what makes the best design so if we could get suggestions as to what will make the game look more sleek it could help our final product.
