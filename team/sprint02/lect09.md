## Stand up Meeting:


Elizabeth: Set up a previous version of the app in itch.io and will work with the team to make sure we finish everything for the MVP.

Dingfan: No updates, looking to help out people with new issues.

Ethan: Got the GUI fixed, has been slowed down by some merge conflicts that are difficult to fix in unity and had to re-write some stuff due to this.

Aashay: Remaking the start page with a start and about button and added in a basic info page connected to the about button, will make a pr soon for this.

Mason: Changed the back button to be in the corner of the page and adjusted self rotation and revolutions. Planning to make the sun more star-like next after the MVP.

Richard: Added the revolution of the planets and added a trail renderer to show the path of every planet.
