# Project: Interactive Solar System

Mentor: Justin, Matthew

Meeting Time: lect08 02/07 15:30-16:45

Type of Meeting: daily scrum

Team:
[x] Aashay Parab
[x] Dingfan Zheng
[x] Elizabeth Armstrong
[x] Ethan Meade
[x] Mason Ma
[x] Richard Yang

Absences: All team members were present. 

## Stand up Meeting:


Aashay: Working on the start and stop page. Has the design down, just the transition needs work. 

Dingfan: Got working on planet rotation, which went smoothly. 

Elizabeth: Finished issue of adding background. Was busy with project and essay; those are done, so they can help with MVP now.

Ethan: Got gravity from Elizabethâ€™s tutorial going. Planets attract each other according to mass and distance, but having trouble creating orbits due to issues with scale / units. 

Mason: Just made a PR before meeting: start button to initalize simulation (a front page before simulation). Made other planets clickable, using mouse to click them. Added a moving function in space to change camera position with WASD (Z up, SPACE down). Made back button for start page. 

Richard: Was also working on a gravity function; the planets can rotate around each other but still have problems with scale and range, distances between planets (they were flying away). Held back because we need to decide what parameters might make sense.
