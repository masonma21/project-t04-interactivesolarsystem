Partial sprint meeting, we’ll get everything settled when we connect with everyone else.  
 
First order of business... we’re using WebGL most likely. Don’t necessarily have to use Unity, but 
have the option using WebGL.  
 
There is a similar project found elsewhere, built with Vue.js (https://github.com/vuejs/core) for 
the framework and three.js (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) for 3D models.  
 
Had difficulty finding Unity libraries that would help; consult with mentors.  
  Unity Physics libraries that we saw seem more tailored to classic games on a planet, 
rather than planets interacting (gravity is just down).  
 
 
We decided to get the groundwork set for Tuesday, and then check-in with mentors to make 
sure everything is being done correctly. 
 
If we have the time we should branch out and try alternatives, but we need to keep the MVP in 
mind.  
 
Reconnect with group and find a way forwards; we’ll try to investigate some of the possible 
technologies before Tuesday. In the meantime, we made starter User Stories / Issues which 
we’ll also refine on Tuesday. 

## 01/24
Meeting Time: 3:30 pm
Meeting Type: Spring Meeting

Attendance: Ethan Meade [x], Elizabeth Armstrong [x], Aashay Parab [x], Dingfan Zheng [x], Mason Ma [x], Richard Yand [x]

Richard: Found a site called itch.io that we could publically publish our Unity app on, using this we would have no need to develop our own web app
and we can focus soley on developing the Unity app 

This has narrowed down our technology search to just developing in Unity

We discussed what we want to have done before the end of the sprint (Friday 01/27). We want to have a base unity app in github that can show a static solar
system with the sun and other planet objects. 

Ethan: found a template for planet graphics that includes all the planets that could be useful for the visual side of our app

Created a Story based on this goal for the end of the week and made sub-issues to be completed.
