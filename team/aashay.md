Hi! My name is Aashay Parab and I'm a third-year CS major. I took CS156 spring 2022 so I have some experience with group based projects. I have some experience with programming languages like C++, Java, Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. 

Some ideas I have for the project: 
1. Interactive website like Google Earth 
2. We can leverage existing 3D libraries like Three.js 
3. We can try to make the website fun by like dropping random objects and seeing the effects of gravity on those object
