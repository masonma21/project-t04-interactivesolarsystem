## Stand up Meeting:


Elizabeth: Made a PR for adding the intermediary scene. It's just the front end right now but we will work on adding the connections to the backend next!

Dingfan: Not many updates, will finish making sun the only lightsource by the end of the week.

Ethan: Been working on helping functions to help out with adding and editing planets, wants to get a PR in tonight. 

Aashay: Almost done with issue. Will make PR soon, making sure the values are what will make keys and mouse smoothest.

Mason: Made a PR and installed changes made in yesterday's lecture

Richard: Added a button on screen to "add planet" and will add a random planet as a template sphere object. Currently no customization options for users. After planets are added to solar systems, real time changed made to existing celestial movements. In the next issue, will try to add a delete function to delete all the random planets that have been added.
Not sure whether we can get to customization before final version.
