## Stand up Meeting:


Elizabeth: Working on intermediary page that allows user to change the settings of the simulation. Still trying to get a scrollbar to work. 

Dingfan: Finished shift hot key and is currently working on changing the lightsource

Ethan: Rotation PR got pushed through. It looks kinda goofy but it could help with working with the time scale. Currently working on backend implementation of editing planets, not sure what other people are doing with adding and editing planet portions. 

Aashay:  Still working on same issue, small roadblock but should still be good.

Mason: Submitted a PR where if you press Q it will pop up a menu and the menu has a back and add button.
