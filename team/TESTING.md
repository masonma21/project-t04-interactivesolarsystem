# Team04 - Interactive Solar System Test Documentation

## Unit Test Implementation
We created some stub tests, located inside the Unity Project under Assets/Tests/EditMode and Assets/Tests/PlayMode.
The tests were created using Unity's own built-in testing framework, which itself makes use of the NUnit test framework. 

We tried to implement unit tests for SolarSystem.cs, but we were unable to get them working; unit testing for MonoBehaviors was unexpectedly challenging. Unfortunately, almost all of the scripts in our project were MonoBehaviors; thus, we made stub tests as a proof of concept. The failed attempts at unit testing SolarSystem.cs can be seen in the branch "EM-Add_First_Unit_Tests", in the same location the stub tests are in main.
