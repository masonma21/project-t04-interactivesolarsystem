 ## Stand up Meeting:

 Elizabeth: Made a PR for the hotkey and will work on implementing testing tonight

 Dingfan: Worked on pausing with the escape button.

 Ethan: Reviewed some PR's and hasn't done anything with integration testing yet because it is hard to make dummy objects. Will go to Mateos OH tonight.

 Aashay: Trying to resolve merge conflicts for PR and will work on mouse behavior

 Mason: Reviewed some of the PR's and made a PR to make the sun more star-like.

 Richard: Added a Pause and Resume button, but it currently has a bug where when the user clicks space, they may resume the simulation or jump to the start menu. Trying to figure out
 why this is happening.
