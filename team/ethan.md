## Regarding me:
I'm a senior computer science student. I took CS 156 ~2 years ago, and CS 184 last Winter quarter. I'm looking forward to working with the team!

## My Vision for the Project:

I was thinking that by default it would simulate our solar system;
users would be able to make modifications as described by the description.

It would be neat to simulate it in 3 dimensions using something like Unity (it's a graphical simulator!). It would be nice to do the simulation using the actual gravity equation, but I don't know if it would be computationally feasible.
