Ideas for the Project:
We could use some web gui to have graphics for showing the planets in space
And then we could use equations from physics to determine the way the planets would interact with eachother
The default could be the way our current solar system is and then give users the option to delete planets and also to add plantets of a chosen size and space to the diagram.
