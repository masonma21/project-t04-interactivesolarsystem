## Retrospective:

### Stop:

Making Kanban board issues without adequate acceptance criteria 

Waiting until the last minute to satisfy deliverables (lab requirements) 

Failing to update the Kanban board when an issue changes phases (from TODO to InProgress when someone assigned, InProgress to In Review when PR created, etc.)




### Start:

Doing 1 pull request per issue

Finish at least one big issue per person every week

Drag issues into “Done” immediately after they are done

Coordinating to avoid merge conflicts 

Using a specific notation / standard for Object/Class names and Project Organization

Holding a dedicated “Story Time” where User Stories are built and issues are assigned to them (basically taking time periodically to tidy up / update the Kanban board as a team)



### Continue:

Communicating with updates on slack 

Having regular stand up meetings in class

Delegating new features to team members

Keeping Kanban board neat with every issue connected to one user story


## Action item

* a goal: Continuously work on issues and respond to changes quickly.

* a change: Speed up the processes of implementing new features.

* a measurement: Keeping every member updated on slack at all times, making sure no one is stuck with their task



## Experiment for next sprint: 

Start: Finish at least one big issue per person every week

Stop: Waiting until the last minute to satisfy deliverables (lab requirements)

Continue: Keeping Kanban board neat with every issue connected to one user story



## Retro Assessment:

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used:

Start, Stop, Continue Retrospective Template

* A brief assessment of how it went:

First, we wrote down things under each section (start/stop/continue) then each one of us had 3 votes in total for those points. Then, those with the most votes were selected as the experiment for the next retro.

* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

I think the retro could be a little more effective if there were more communication between team members.


## Retro Outcome:

I think we are getting everyone back on track from preMVP to postMVP issues. This retro is effective in speeding up our progress on new feature implementations. We also need to make sure that our kanban boards are neat and up to date.
