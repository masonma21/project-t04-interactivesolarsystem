- Start, Stop, Continue Retrospective Template

### A brief assessment of how it went:
- Our retrospective meeting for this week followed the same format as the previous meetings (start/stop/continue). 
- We discussed some of the roadblocks we were facing as a team since our progress toward our final product stagnated a little bit. 
- There was consensus across the team that we need to refocus and finish our high-priority issues, maintain strong and clear communication, and keep pushing toward our final product before the code freeze next Friday. 

### What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?
- Ensure that everyone is participating and communicating well 
- Be prepared for the retro beforehand to make it more efficient 
- Clarify any confusing experiments or expectations with everyone on the team

### Retro Outcome:
- Overall, we addressed the issues we were facing and concluded that we all need to put our heads together and keep pushing toward our final product idea before the deadline. 
- We need to be in constant communication with each other and be transparent about our progress. 
- We need to shift our focus to high-priority issues and make the product as good as possible (meeting the major expectations we set for ourselves at the start of the quarter).
