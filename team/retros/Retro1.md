## Action item

* a goal: Continue working on issues and respond to changes quickly.

* a measurement: Communicate with team members on slack, help each other when in need, and share learning resources.


## Experiment for next sprint:

Stop: Forgetting updating the Kanban Board

Continue: Communicating with team members on slack



## Retro Assessment:

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used:

Start, Stop, Continue Retrospective Template

* A brief assessment of how it went:

First, we wrote down things under each section (start/stop/continue) then each one of us had 3 votes in total for those points. Then, those with the most votes were selected as the experiment for the next retro.

* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

I think if the whole team can write down things before the retro, the discussion would be more effective and we will have more time to come up with measurements to help the team achieve the goal.


## Retro Outcome:

I think we did a good job in communicating with team members on slack, helping each other when in need, and sharing learning resources. We need to continue reviewing the Kanban board at the beginning of class together in case we might miss any issues.
